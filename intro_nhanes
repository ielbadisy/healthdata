-   Exposure :

    -   `arthritis` = RA (rheumatoid arthritis)

-   Confounders and risk factors :

    -   `bmi` = body mass index
    -   `diabetes` = have diabetes (Yes/No)
    -   `smoke` = smoking (Yes/No)
    -   `alcohol` = alcohol drinking (Yes/No)
    -   `prehypertension` = prehypertension (Yes/No)
    -   `age`
    -   `vegetarian` = vegetarian regime (Yes/no)
    -   `covered.health` = acces to health services (Yes/No)
